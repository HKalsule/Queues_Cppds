# Queues_Cppds(InterviewBit)
Queues are another fascinating data structure, quite the opposite of stacks in some ways. While a stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, a queue adheres to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Think of it like waiting in line; the first person who arrives is the first one to be served.

In C++, you can implement queues using the Standard Template Library (STL) as well. The std::queue provides a simple and efficient interface for working with queues.

Here's a quick overview of basic queue operations:

Enqueue (or Push): Adds an element to the back (or rear) of the queue.

Dequeue (or Pop): Removes the element from the front (or front) of the queue. The first element that was added is the first to be removed.

Front: Retrieves the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.

Size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
